This is a simple todo list that i have used concepts of arrays on js to make.
it has home core html.
it also has some css that has styled it.
One is able to type work that one is planning to do as input.
And also set the date.
Then finally add it to the list as many as possible.
Also one is able to delete the work after one is done.
